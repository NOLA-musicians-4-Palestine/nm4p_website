## New Orleans Stop Helping Israel’s Ports (NOSHIP)

NOSHIP is committed to ending economic and cultural ties between New Orleans and Israel by putting pressure on New Orleans business leaders and lawmakers.

NOSHIP members give public comment at the Port of New Orleans monthly board meetings, and they join other groups advocating for a Ceasefire Resolution at biweekly New Orleans City meetings.
NOSHIP committees plan and support local rallies and actions, and research and publicize information regarding weapons manufacturing facilities and the transfer of weapons to Israel.

General meetings are every Thursday at 6:00 p.m. with the option to attend by Zoom or in person.
You do not have to be a member to attend meetings.
