### Events

#### Design

- [x] Horizontal Scrolling cards
- [x] flyer
- [x] formatted info on click
- [x] sort by date fuck ya it's automatic
- [ ] date-based navigation (for later in javascript)
- [x] do not show past events


The community calendar,I was thinking cards scrolling horizontally?

Flyers - forget supporting just text. you need a flyer.

#### thoughts

thoughts on easily getting people's events listed here:
we could make an instagram account and follow only members
set notification settings to get emails when anyone posts
it'd be someone's job to check the email daily and post the new stuff on the site
maybe that could be automated?

Probably a better system would be to have an email go out to the contact we have on file for each org/band asking them to reply with their events and flyers
