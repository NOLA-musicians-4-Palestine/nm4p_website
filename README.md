# site structure

## Home

- invite people to join
- display the mission statement and members/endorsers/partners
- members kept in data?

## Events

The community calendar, I was thinking cards scrolling horizontally?
- may need an event 'post type' that either uses a flyer background or a text template
- maybe it'd be good to filter or flip through quickly

## Plug In
pretty regular blog where orgs can post updates

## Band

### Rep List

Current rep/not started/learning
- song list maybe in data

Chart finder at the bottom

song > part > transposition > clef >

### Song Pages
Each song should have a page with
 - reference recordings
 - rehearsal recordings
 - arrangement notes
 - charts/files

### Chart Pages
	
chart page should have the chart and the chart finder at the top
