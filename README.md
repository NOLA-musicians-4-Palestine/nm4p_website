# site structure and status

## Home

- [x] invite people to join
- [x] display the mission statement and members/endorsers/partners
(text is not final, I've gotta get what's been done on the doc)

## Go Out! Plug In!

### Events

The community calendar,I was thinking cards scrolling horizontally?
Flyers - forget supporting just text. you need a flyer.

#### Design

- [x] Horizontal Scrolling cards
- [x] flyer
- [x] formatted info on click
- [x] sort by date fuck ya it's automatic
- [ ] date-based navigation (for later in javascript)
- [ ] filter by event type (show/action/both)
- [x] do not show past events

#### thoughts

thoughts on easily getting people's events listed here:
we could make an instagram account and follow only members
set notification settings to get emails when anyone posts
it'd be someone's job to check the email daily and post the new stuff on the site
maybe that could be automated?

Probably a better system would be to have an email go out to the contact we have on file for each org/band asking them to reply with their events and flyers

I made nolamusicians4Palestine@gmail.com and made this event submission form (for the free storage)
where people can upload their flyers and info

I'm hoping to automate the posting/reviewing process
