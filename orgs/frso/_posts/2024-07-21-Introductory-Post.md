Freedom Road Socialist Organization (FRSO) is a national organization of revolutionaries fighting for socialism in the United States.
FRSO members are rooted in the mass movements for justice, particularly in the labor movement and the movements of oppressed nations and nationalities– especially African-Americans and Chicanos.
FRSO is active in the immigrant rights, anti-war, student and youth movements, and is organizing the united front against monopoly capitalism — with the strategic alliance of the multinational working class and oppressed nationality movements at its core.

In the New Orleans area, FRSO members are involved in union and student organizing,
