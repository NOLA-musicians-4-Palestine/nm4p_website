</div>

<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
<p>
	As the name suggests, we're musicians who live or work or pass through New Orleans that are using our collective voice to call for an end to the genocide in Palestine, and the US's support of Israel. We're brass players, string players, solo artists, Jazz musicians, folk musicians, composers, even drummers :). People come here to listen to us, so let's tell them where we're at!
</p>

<p>
	Nola Musicians for Palestine exists to demonstrate the support of a culturally significant group (Musicians in New Orleans) for the Palestinian cause, to inspire people to join the movement and to channel our energy and the energy of our audiences towards local organizing efforts.
	Nola Musicians for Palestine is an avenue for us to use our collective voice to speak out against apartheid, genocide, racism, fascism, and imperialism, in support of the Palestinian struggle and the many other struggles that are connected at its core.
	We embrace the unique ways that we as musicians can strengthen the movement, by demonstrating connectivity of struggles through the connectivity of music, uplifting Palestinian culture and the cultures of other groups oppressed by the same forces, energizing protests and actions with music and rhythm, and transforming our gigs into political spaces and spreading information at our workplaces, which are some of the most widespread and frequently visited gathering places in our city.
