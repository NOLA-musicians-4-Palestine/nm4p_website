Doors open at 6pm at @broadsidenola. @sulaspirit will bless the evening and MC. Nola Strings for Palestine open, and Performer “Extraordinaire” (Andrea Bellair) the 9th Wonder of the World performs between sets. @cristina.kaminis.music will have everyone dancing, and @assatarenay closes the night as our headliner. You don’t want to miss any of these incredible and soulful artists.

Silent auction all evening. Cash bar. Food for sale by @calle86llc and @ohboypoboys.

All ages welcome! The outdoor space is wheelchair accessible, though some paths are made of small pebbles. Let us know if you need anything in order to attend.
