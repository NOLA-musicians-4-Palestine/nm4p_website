## Calling All New Orleans Musicians!

As we enter the 2nd Carnival Season over the backdrop of genocide in Palestine,
musicians raise our instruments in protest again. Without support
from the U.S. Israel's deranged rampage would not be possible.
It is our responsibility to speak loudly and clearly in opposition to our
city's continued support for Israel's genocide especially at a time when
we have our city's attention.

If you'd like to march with us please check the [band resources](./band.html)
page for rehearsal schedules, example recordings, sheet music, and more.

## Artists!

We'll be having two Art Builds in preparation for the procession
- Friday 1/3 from 5-8pm at the Fred Hampton Free Store (5523 St. Claude Ave.)
- Saturday 1/4 from 4-8pm at First Grace (3401 Canal St.)
