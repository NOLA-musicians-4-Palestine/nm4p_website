The [Democratic Socialists of America (DSA)](https://www.dsausa.org/) is a national organization of socialists fighting to weaken the power of corporations and the rich, and strengthen the power of poor and working people.
DSA has over 80,000 members nationwide, and hundreds of chapters in communities across the U.S.
The [New Orleans Chapter of DSA](https://www.dsaneworleans.org/) organizes locally with more than 250 members to build working class power in southeastern Louisiana.

New Orleans DSA general membership meetings and most committee meetings are open to the public.
The Chapter is currently working on the [Make Entergy Pay Campaign](https://makeentergypay.com/) and regularly hosts [Health Fair + Brake Light Clinics](https://www.dsaneworleans.org/events/2023/05/13/health-fair-brake-light-clinic).
